DDR is a set of tools for constructing a distributed repository suitable for the archival preservation of media files and metadata.  It is built from standard open-source components, uses archival standard metadata formats, and provides for replication of collections under low- or no-bandwidth conditions.

**ddr-cmdln** is a set of command-line tools which automates various low-level DDR processes.  Processes include the creation and management of collections, entities, and media files, the creation of repository clones, and the synchronization of collection repositories with each other.
